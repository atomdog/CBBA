## Data Used in Study
### Central Sources
- Complaints (to form network)
### Additional Sources
- Shootings
- Settlements
- Personnel data
- Arrest data
- Tactical Response data
- Historical police crews, ie Skullcap & Watts

## Key Methodology Components
### Network Formation
- Officers with more than one complaint comprised the nodes in the network
- Edges represent a co-accusal on a complaint
- Edge smoothing and weighting were applied
### Network Analysis
- Additional Sources validated cliques identified network
- Known historical data was used to back things up

## Feasibility in Boston
### Readily Available Data
- [Complaints via wokewindows](https://www.wokewindows.org/data_sources/allegations_2010_to_2020)
- [FIO Data via BA](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/boston-police-department-fio)
- [Shootings Data via BA](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/shootings)
- [Crime Incident Reports via BA](https://data.boston.gov/dataset/crime-incident-reports-august-2015-to-date-source-new-system)

### Feasibility
#### With Readily Available Data
- Following a near identical methodology to that which was outlined in the paper would be straightforward
- Given BA datasets are updated, this could also be done in real time, with an opportunity to validate prior predictions
