** QUESTIONS **

## Tuesday, June 21, 2022
-  City Council: 
  - Planning & Development
    - Allston-Brighton Master Plan
    - Landuse, zoning, parcel assessment
    - Impact advisory groups (IAGs)
  - Affordable housing
  - Census and demography
    - Housing unit counts (certificates of occupancy)
    - Population projections (Development pipeline; transportation demand)
  - City Governances
- Lack of standardization
  - Lack of mapping, lack of standard data collection through departments
  - Legislation exists in state law, as city was not re-constituted in 60s/70s like most cities
  - Wayne's datasets are manually created, not in analyzeboston, 
  - No centralized pages to track appointments
  - 200 boards and commissions, 400-500 unique seats, some sitting advisory group members are on 10-11 different comissions
  - Institutions are obviously very interesting
  - PILOT Institute property valuation, PILOT contributions not tracked well
  - Nonprofits don't have to pay taxes, they own a lot of land, schools must pay fair share in lieu of taxes !!!!! 
- Boston Planning and Development 
  - They have a lot of tools, and other departments go to them
  - Informative tool IF the mayor wanted the information
  - No way to assess scale of undercount
  - Whatever analysis of landuse and property ownership is possible
  - Max ord. violation fee is 300, landlords simply pay this and do not fix conditions
- Really about aggregating information; affordable housing, price points, etc.
- Rank ordered priority:
  - Huge number of rental properties; proposed penalties for problem landlords
  - Housing inspection stored in paper (OCR?) ordinance provides tenets legal right to access previous inspection of buildings
- Top priorities:
  - Big need for development tracker, things are fragmented (are they consistently fragmented?, PDF search tool...)
  - see the levels of affordability 
  - [massbuilds](massbuilds.com) could be improved
  - draft proposal, (distribution of x, y, z; bad actor landlords, where are the problems, etc, SCOFF law)
