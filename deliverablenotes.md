## deliverable notes

#### On the data:
- Still waiting on requested data
- Considering the real viability of requesting data versus just providing cleaned dataset in several formats
  - Seriously painful to match all edge cases in pulled data
  - Would cut code needed by ~25% 
  - Dependent on desire to teach real world skills, most data is not cleaned or strangely formatted
 
#### On the visualizations:
- Still struggling to make ones that look decent/readable, lots of strange formatting issues along the way
- ![Not great](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44831139/182693622-fc122ca0-0d9d-45ee-988a-02f1b94c11db.png)
- Written passable, easy as possible, scatter() method for data

#### On the code:
- Matched all edge cases for city earnings data
- Added unit testing
- Added better function descriptions

#### Otherwise:
- Got flat out rejected by WokeWindows
- Sample base deliverable very close to done
- extension deliverable will be separate file, sample base deliverable covers all the bases for importing
